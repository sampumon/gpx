Operates your Skytraq GPS logger stick. Requires gpsbabel. Run "gpx" for usage.
Useful for simplifying the routes so that Google Maps doesn't split them.

I have Ventus GPS Route Logger G730. Some info (for linux) here:

"Installation guide" for OS X:

1. Install bundled software, this installs the required PL2303 USB-serial driver.
Or, maybe get the driver from Profilic: www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?id=31

2. Install gpsbabel. Available from homebrew or gpsbabel homepage.

Done! Now some skiing on the sea!
